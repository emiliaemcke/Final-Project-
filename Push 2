// The different things i want to instruct the user to draw: a bee, a boat, a guitar, a hot air ballon
// I also then initially want it to be controlled by something simple like the pressing of keeps and then once I have understood that aybe attempt something more complex
// i started by creating a sort of basis for this to work
// starting by playing with text a little bit next I need to figure out how to use Pshape and such to draw groups of lines into shapes! 
PImage mouseIcon; // Mouse image
boolean playAnimation = false;
// Illustration
//PShape shapeGroup;
//PShape drawingShape;
//PShape drawShape;

void setup () {
  size(1000, 800);
  // Set initial shape mode
 // shapeGroup = createShape(GROUP);   // save the group of lines as one  (this isn't working yet obviusly cause I havent really figured it out but ill get there !
 // drawingShape = createShape(GROUP); // save the group of shapes 
 // drawShape = createShape();         // Line
  // Load images
  mouseIcon = loadImage ("Harold.png");
}

void draw () {

  colorMode(RGB, 255);
  background(255);  // Draw the background (white)

 // DrawLine();

  // Drawing the text that guides the animation 
  fill(0);
  textSize(32);

  if (playAnimation) {
    textAlign(LEFT, TOP);
    text("Animating...", 10, 10);
    textAlign(RIGHT, TOP);
  } else {
    textAlign(RIGHT, TOP);
    text("Change type with key 1-4", width-10, 10); // instructions in the top right corner 
    text("'R' to clear", width-10, 50); // instructions in the top right corner 
    text("'Q' undo the drawing", width-10, 90); // instructions in the top right corner 
  }
}
